# lambdacomparator
1-to-1 mapping between integers and all possible lambda functions (plus 1 more for nonhalters). Average constant time, and worst case linear time, implementation of java.util.Comparator&lt;Lambda>, with godel-quality guarantee that for any Lambda x and Lambda y, compare(x,y)==0 (aka x.equals(y)) if-and-only-if forAll z, (x z).equals(y z) &amp;&amp; (z x).equals(z y), and compare func always halts in worst case linear (of memory used by x and y). Examples will be provided of common algorithms including sub-n-cubed matrix multiply, n*n*log(n)^someSmallConstant editDistance, n*log(n)^someSmallConstant. Representation of a function of unique behavior is a universal lambda of always 6 curried parameters
